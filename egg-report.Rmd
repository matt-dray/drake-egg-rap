## Background

The ['latest UK egg statistics' publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics) contains the latest quarterly UK statistics about eggs.

It's published by the [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs).

This report is the output from a demo of using [the {drake} package](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) for R. It's not an official government publication.

## Throughput

Below is a recreation of Figure 2 from the [UK egg statistics notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics) document. It shows egg production over time, split by production methods.

```{r, egg-throughput, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=100}
library(drake)
readd(plot)
```

The eggs are class A and there are 360 eggs per case.

The data are available from the [UK egg packing station throughput and prices dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics). The data set is Crown copyright but may be reproduced without formal permission or charge for personal or in-house use.
