The ['latest UK egg statistics' publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics) contains the latest quarterly UK statistics about eggs.

It's published by the [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs).

## Throughput

Below is a recreation of Figure 2 from the [UK egg statistics notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics) document. It shows egg production over time, split by production methods.

```{r, egg-throughput, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=100}
