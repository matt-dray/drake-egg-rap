# drake-egg-rap

## Purpose

This repo is for testing [the {drake} package](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) by [Will Landau](https://wlandau.github.io/).

>drake is a pipeline toolkit (https://github.com/pditommaso/awesome-pipeline) and a scalable, R-focused solution for reproducibility and high-performance computing.

It will probably be helpful for the UK government's [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/) approach to producing statistical publications.

The repo contains a {drake} workflow for creating a demo statistics publication using the [latest UK egg statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/egg-statistics) as its input. The output is an [HTML publication](https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/) styled using the {govdown} package from [Duncan Garmonsway](https://nacnudus.github.io/duncangarmonsway/).
